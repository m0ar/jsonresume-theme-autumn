      "reference": "I had the pleasure of working closely with Edvard during his time at DeSci Labs, where he first joined as Senior Software Engineer and later took on the role of Protocol Architect for the CODEX protocol. Edvard designed the CODEX protocol from scratch — a decentralized infrastructure for scientific publishing built on technologies such as Ceramic and IPFS. The architecture he developed is novel and ambitious, enabling structured, verifiable, and interoperable scholarly records beyond traditional journal systems. His work laid the technical foundation for the project and was instrumental in helping us secure and successfully complete a major grant from the Navigation Fund for Open Science infrastructure. What stands out about Edvard is his ability to work independently on highly complex systems. He translated high-level vision into a concrete protocol design and implemented most of it himself. He consistently improved backend services, developer tooling, and cloud infrastructure, and built integration SDKs that allowed others to interact with the system. His structured and reliable execution style meant that when Edvard committed to something, it got done — thoughtfully and with care. Beyond his technical contributions, Edvard introduced monthly team retrospectives, which he often chaired. These sessions improved communication, created space for reflection, and were appreciated by the team. He fits well into collaborative environments and values clarity, long-term thinking, and well-defined architecture. Edvard is exceptionally smart, diligent, and responsible. He thrives when working on deep technical problems that require focus and architectural rigor. I am grateful for the foundation he built and would recommend him strongly for roles involving decentralized systems, protocol design, or backend architecture."

      "reference": "Edvard is a talented developer that any team could benefit from. He embodies the rare combination of a strong technical background, gifted communicator, and synergistic collaborator. He was able to pick up the codebase of one our projects quickly without much assistance, and started contributing improvements almost immediately, cementing himself as a keystone for the team. He has a keen eye for taking a step back and refactoring complex systems as they evolve. He’s self-directed and can be trusted to deliver comprehensive solutions even with minimal oversight. If given the opportunity, I would love to work with Edvard again."

But perhaps more importantly, he’s a great collaborator who pushed the team to drive out inefficiencies in our architecture and workflows. Edvard seamlessly onboarded into our technology stack, bringing fresh perspective and identifying bottlenecks that were difficult for the rest of us to see. In short order, he was taking ownership of big picture improvements that made our code more idiomatic and easier to change. The design improvements that he drove make our work easier to this day, months after he’s rolled off. I’d love the opportunity to work with him again, and know he’ll be a great benefit to any team."
