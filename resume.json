He was able to pick up the codebase of one our projects quickly without much assistance, and started contributing improvements almost immediately, cementing himself as a keystone for the team. He has a keen eye for taking a step back and refactoring complex systems as they evolve. He’s self-directed and can be trusted to deliver comprehensive solutions even with minimal oversight. If given the opportunity, I would love to work with Edvard again."

But perhaps more importantly, he’s a great collaborator who pushed the team to drive out inefficiencies in our architecture and workflows. Edvard seamlessly onboarded into our technology stack, bringing fresh perspective and identifying bottlenecks that were difficult for the rest of us to see. In short order, he was taking ownership of big picture improvements that made our code more idiomatic and easier to change. The design improvements that he drove make our work easier to this day, months after he’s rolled off. I’d love the opportunity to work with him again, and know he’ll be a great benefit to any team."
